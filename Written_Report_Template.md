# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This analysis was created to demonstrate how other campaigns performed in relation to "Fever" in regards to launch date and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis began with adding an additional column to display the years of when the campaigns were launched. From there a pivot table was created in a new sheet titled "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" to show the months of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. Next a chart was created to better visualize the pivot table as seen in the link below:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After this a new worksheet titled "Outcomes Based on Goals" was created and inside of it data was organized to display the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays and their relative percentages sectioned into twelve tiers ranging from less than one-thousand to greater than fifty-thousand. From this data organization a chart was created to visualize the results as pictured in the link below:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges I faced in this module were writing the CountIfs because there were several different criteria involved with organizing the data in "Outcomes Based on Goals". I overcame this challenge by rewatching the video multiple times and utilizing the insert funcion feature to break down the criteria into different sections. 

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion about Outcomes based on launch date is that successful campaigns see a sharp increase in success if they launch in May. A second conclusion that can be drawn is that failed campaigns see a high rate in October and May. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
One conclusion that can be drawn is that no campaigns that were ran to raise funds for plays were canceled, they all reached a definitive end result. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations of this data set are that they do not provide the subcategory of city in which these campaigns were ran and the data ends 5 years ago. We need more recent data and more specific location about what cities the plays were held in. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would recommend a graph that displays the average month, average amount of days, verage goal, average amount of backers, and average amount pledged to get a highly successful view of what can be replicated.
